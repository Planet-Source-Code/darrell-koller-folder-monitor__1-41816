### Description

Folder Monitor is a class written in Visual Basic 6.0 that monitors changes made to files in a specified directory (folder) or directories (folders) and its subdirectories (subfolders). It uses the Windows API functions WaitForMultipleObjects, FindFirstChangeNotification, FindNextChangeNotification, and FindCloseChangeNotification.
 
### More Info
 
Okay, sorry about the MSI (Microsoft Installer) package. Geez, what happened to the days where you could trust people? The code is repackaged in a zip - no executables. This is my first contribution here (and thanks to some of the smart _ss comments, perhaps my last). This demo was not originally put together for distribution on PSC.
